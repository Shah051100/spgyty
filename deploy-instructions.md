# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

Your portfolio is ready for GitHub Pages deployment. Follow these steps to fix the 404 error:

## 🚀 Steps to Deploy (UPDATED)

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `peerzada-saadat-portfolio`
3. Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)

### 2. Upload Your Files
Upload all these files to your GitHub repository:
- All folders: `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`, `attached_assets/`, `.github/`, `docs/`
- All config files: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, etc.
- The build scripts: `build-github-pages.js` and `build-static.js`
- This README: `README.md`

### 3. Configure GitHub Pages (IMPORTANT)
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Click on "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main" branch and "/docs folder"
5. Click Save

### 4. Alternative: Use GitHub Actions
If you prefer automatic deployment:
1. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
2. Your site will build automatically when you push code

### 5. Your Site Goes Live
- Your portfolio will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`
- The build process takes 2-3 minutes
- Check the "Actions" tab to see build progress
