# Fix for GitHub Pages 404 Error

## The Problem
Your GitHub Pages site is showing a 404 error because the deployment configuration needs to be updated.

## The Solution
I've created a new build process that generates files in the `/docs` folder, which is the standard GitHub Pages deployment method.

## What to Do Now

### Option 1: Simple /docs Folder Method (Recommended)
1. **Upload the `/docs` folder** to your GitHub repository
2. **Go to Settings > Pages** in your repository
3. **Change Source to "Deploy from a branch"**
4. **Select "main branch" and "/docs folder"**
5. **Click Save**

### Option 2: GitHub Actions Method
1. **Upload all files** including the `.github/workflows/` folder
2. **Go to Settings > Pages** in your repository
3. **Select "GitHub Actions" as source**
4. **Push your code** - it will build automatically

## Files Ready for Upload

Your complete portfolio is now built and ready in these locations:
- **`/docs` folder** - Complete static website ready to deploy
- **`/dist` folder** - Alternative build output
- **All source files** - For GitHub Actions automatic deployment

## What's Fixed

✅ **Static Build**: No server needed - pure HTML/CSS/JS
✅ **Contact Form**: Uses email client (mailto links)
✅ **All Images**: Your personal photos properly included
✅ **CV Download**: Your actual resume file included
✅ **Relative Paths**: All links work correctly on GitHub Pages

## Expected Result
Once configured correctly, your portfolio will be live at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

The 404 error will be resolved and your cyberpunk-themed portfolio will display perfectly with all your authentic content, animations, and functionality.
